		<p>My name is Omri Arad,and since I was a little boy I had this obsession about space and everything connected to it.
		Growing up I watched shows about space,read A lot of sci-fi books and even looked at the moon through my uncle’s telescope.
		nowadays i usually watch documentaries and read articles.
	</p>
	<p> A couple of years ago i discovered a video game named “Elite Dangerous” which i play with a “hotas”(hands on throttle-and-stick)
		that lets you fly a spaceship in a 1 on 1 scale of our galaxy “the milky way”.
		i'm just having a blast visiting our solar system,checking out all the wired(and cool!) stuff we have in our universe such as:black holes,neutron stars,pulsars and what not.
	</p>
	<p>Anyway,I am really excited about the James Webb telescope,I think it's going to expand our knowledge about our universe by a tenfold!
		and of course provide us with some stunning pictures.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>I can't wait for it to start working.
